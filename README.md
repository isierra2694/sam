# Smart Aquarium Monitor (SAM)
## Project Summary:
The Smart Aquarium Monitor App (SAM) is engineered to enhance the management of
saltwater aquariums through real-time monitoring of salinity and temperature. This innovative
application simulates connecting to sensors within aquariums to provide immediate data and
alerts, ensuring optimal conditions for marine life.

SAM was created by Dylan Canfield, Marcel Rodriguez, and Harrison Sierra for our Software Development Capstone class at WCC.
